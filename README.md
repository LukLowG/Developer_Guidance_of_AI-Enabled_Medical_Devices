# FDA AI/ML SaMD Guideline Exploration

This project breaks down the FDAâ€™s 2024 draft regulations on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Software as a Medical Device (SaMD), including:

- Predetermined Change Control Plans (PCCP)
- Transparency Principles for ML-enabled devices

The goal is to make these regulatory frameworks actionable for developers and researchers working on AI-driven medical technologies.

## Goals

- Understand and summarize key FDA guidelines
- Build reusable templates and checklists
- Apply principles to hypothetical or real AI healthcare tools
