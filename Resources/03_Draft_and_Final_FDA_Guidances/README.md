# FDA Final Guidance on PCCPs for AI-Enabled Device Software Functions  
## Section Summary: Scope

This document summarizes the **Scope** section of the FDA's final guidance on **Predetermined Change Control Plans (PCCPs)** for AI-enabled device software functions (AI-DSFs), issued December 2024.

---

## What Devices Are Covered?

This guidance applies to **AI-Enabled Device Software Functions (AI-DSFs)** that manufacturers intend to **modify over time**. This includes:

- Devices using **machine learning (ML)** or other artificial intelligence (AI) techniques
- **Automatically updating** systems (e.g., continuous learning)
- **Manually updated** systems (e.g., human-in-the-loop decision-making)
- Devices submitted through:
  - **Premarket Approval (PMA)**
  - **510(k) Notification**
  - **De Novo Classification**

---

## What the Guidance Includes

A **PCCP** is intended to authorize changes that would typically require a new submission, including:

- **Significant modifications** that could:
  - Affect the **safety** or **effectiveness** of the device
  - Change its **intended use**

These changes must be:

- Clearly defined in the **Description of Modifications**
- Verified and validated per the **Modification Protocol**
- Assessed through a formal **Impact Assessment**

---

## What the Guidance Excludes

This guidance does **not cover**:

- Minor modifications that **do not require a new marketing submission**
- Changes managed under the **Quality System Regulation (QSR)**, which must:
  - Be documented in the **Device Master Record**
  - Be included in **post-approval reports** (if applicable to PMAs)

---

## Combination Products

For **device-led combination products** (e.g., AI device combined with a drug or biologic):

- The guidance **applies only** to the **device software** component (AI-DSF)
- It does **not apply** to the **drug or biologic** constituents
- **Early FDA engagement** is recommended, especially if changes affect the combination product as a whole

---

## Implementation Highlights

- An **authorized PCCP** allows for pre-approved changes to be made **without**:
  - Re-submitting for a PMA supplement
  - Filing a new 510(k) submission
- This approach **streamlines iterative development** of AI-enabled devices while maintaining regulatory oversight

---

## FDA Recommendation

Manufacturers are **encouraged to engage early** with FDA using the **Q-Submission Program** to ensure:

- The scope of the PCCP is appropriate
- The evidence supports continued safety and effectiveness
