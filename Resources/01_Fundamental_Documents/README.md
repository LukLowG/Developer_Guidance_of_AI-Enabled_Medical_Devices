# Proposed Regulatory Framework for Modifications to Artificial

Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-Based Software as a Medical Device
(SaMD) - Discussion Paper and Request for Feedback

## Chapter 1: Introduction – Expanded Summary with SaMD Context

- What is SaMD?
  - Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) is defined as software intended to be used for medical purposes without being part of a hardware medical device.
  - This includes software that, for example:
    - Diagnoses conditions using imaging data.
    - Predicts risk of disease progression.
    - Supports clinical decisions.

  - The International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) provides the commonly accepted framework for SaMD, which the FDA follows.

- Why SaMD Needs a New Approach with AI/ML

  - Traditional SaMD is typically “locked” — it doesn’t change after approval.
  - But AI/ML-based SaMD can continuously learn, improve, or drift in performance after deployment.
  - The FDA recognizes that this adaptive nature challenges current review pathways.

- First Discussion Paper proposes:

  - A Total Product Lifecycle (TPLC) approach to regulate AI/ML-based SaMD:
    - From initial development to real-world use and ongoing updates.

  - The aim is to ensure:

    - Safety and effectiveness are maintained over time.
    - Manufacturers can pre-plan certain modifications, reducing regulatory burden.
    - Patients and providers maintain trust and understanding in how the AI behaves.
